# DogBreedContract
Project For ConsenSys Academy
# About
This is a work in progress project called DogBreedContract. It is designed for transparency in buying and selling dogs that are properly breed to a certain standard. To assure that these standards are met, a verifier is the only person who can add a dog for sale once it has been verified and the standards are met. Once the dog is added to the list, a buyer can choose which dog to buy from the list by looking at it's credentials. Once the dog is bought, the transaction will go through and the dog will be marked by the buyer once the dog is received.
